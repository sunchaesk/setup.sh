# setup.sh
E+ setup script

# What the script does
Installs Energyplus V23.1 to the folder Eplus

- NOTE: script creates the Energyplus download folder Eplus relative to the directory where the script was run
- NOTE: script is simply fetching the prebuilt binary from the official EnergyPlus releases (built for CentOS 7)

**Script was developed to use on high performance computers for parallel runs of Energyplus**
**The script fetches Energyplus 23.1 for CentOS, but for other versions, change the download path in the script**
